# BSE STAR MF Integration - Real API Configuration

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to configure the Order Management System to use real BSE STAR MF API services instead of mock implementations.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Mock Implementation**:
   - Deleted `src/bse_integration/mock.py` which contained mock implementations
   - Deleted `tests/test_config.py` which contained mock test configurations

2. **Updated Dependencies**:
   - Modified `src/dependencies.py` to use real BSE services
   - Removed all mock imports and implementations
   - Uncommented the real service initialization code

3. **Updated Configuration**:
   - Ensured `USE_MOCK_BSE` is set to `False` in `src/bse_integration/config.py`
   - Configured with real BSE credentials:
     - User ID: 6385101
     - Member Code: 63851
     - Password: Abc@1234

4. **Updated Main Application**:
   - Modified `src/main.py` to remove mock-related code
   - Updated startup message to indicate real BSE services are being used

5. **Created Test Script**:
   - Added `test_real_bse_auth.py` to verify authentication with real BSE credentials
   - Confirmed successful authentication with the BSE STAR MF API

## Testing

The real BSE integration has been tested and confirmed working:

- Authentication with BSE STAR MF API is successful
- Encrypted password is obtained correctly
- Session management is working as expected

## Next Steps

1. Implement and test order placement with real BSE API
2. Implement and test client registration with real BSE API
3. Implement and test SIP registration with real BSE API
4. Implement real price discovery service

## Notes

- The BSE STAR MF API requires HTTPS connections
- Authentication sessions are valid for 1 hour
- The `/Secure` endpoint must be used for secure API calls
- Response format for authentication is "100|encryptedPassword"
